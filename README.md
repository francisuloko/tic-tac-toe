# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

> Building a Ruby game of TicTacToe following OOP methodologies

![screenshot](./assets/screenshot.png)

This is a colloborative project to build a game of TicTacToe puting into practice
the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). We have demonstrated the use of
classes in Ruby and how to access their properties and methods. Here is a brief description
of TicTacToe.

TicTacToe - "a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row,
a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces
of a grid of nine squares" (Oxford Dictionary).

## Game Rules

1. Player Wins Game when they place 3 marks (`X` or `O`) in a row either horizontally,
   vertically or diagonally. 
2. Draw Game, when no 3 consecutive marks and no available cell.
3. Player 1 starts the game with `X`

## How to Play

1. Enter Player 1 name
2. Enter Player 2 name
3. Player 1 selects available cell
4. Player 2 takes turn and selects available cell
5. Repeat steps 3 & 4 until round complete
